# Streamlit-Based LSTM S&P 500 Technology Stock Price Predictor

## This streamlit based web app takes live stock data from Yahoo Finance from the S&P 500 Information Technology sector and uses it to predict the stock price for the next two months using a LSTM model optimized using Bayesian Optimization. Using this prediction, the app makes a recommendation about whether the user should buy or sell the stock. Please look at the paper ("Final Report.pdf") for more details on the project.
